//for (let...in)
    //The for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, including properties inherited from its prototype chain.
    //It iterates over the keys (property names) of an object.
    //It's typically used with OBJECT to enumerate their properties.
//for (let...of)
    //The for...of loop iterates over the values of an iterable object, such as arrays, strings, or objects that implement the iterable protocol.
    //It directly accesses the values of the collection.
    //It's commonly used with ARRAY to iterate over their elements.
